create_page:
    question: |
        I've just created pets_new.php. Add the require statements so that
        we have our normal header and footer. Then, add an h1 tag in the
        middle of the page.
    worker: php
    entry_point: pets_new.php
    skeletons:
        pets_new.php: blank.php
        layout/header.php: layout/header.php
        layout/footer.php: layout/footer.php
    asserts: CreatePageSuite.php
