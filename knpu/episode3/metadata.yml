    Woh, this is episode 3 of our Epic PHP series!
    
    * [Episode 1](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/php-ep1).
    * [Episode 2](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/php-ep2).

    This course is a work-in-progress, but if you subscribe (upper right
    corner of this page), we'll email you when new chapters are added and

    After all you've learned in episodes 1 and 2, it's time to keep going
    by reading and writing from a database, and a whole lot more.
    
    We'll learn how to develop with PHP with a real project, and **coding exercises**
    throughout the screencast so you can practice immediately.
