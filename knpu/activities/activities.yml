print_string1:
    question: |
        Use PHP to print out the string "Hello world" between the `<h1>` and `</h1>` tags

    skeletons: { index.php: shared/index.php }
    asserts: Print1/PrintStringSuite.php

set_var2:
    question: |
        Now create a variable called `$pageTitle` and set it to the string "Hello World". Print this variable out inside the h1 tag.

set_var_pupcount_3:
    question: |
        Now create a second variable called `$pupCount` and set it to the number 50. Then print this inside the `<div class="count">` element.
    skeletons: { index.php: SetVarPupCount3/index.php }

#case_sensitivity_4:
#    question: |
#        Is echo case sensitive (i.e. does ECHO work)? What about variable names - can we set `$pageTitle` and then print
#        `$PAGETITLE`? Does that work? Try it out below to find out.
#    answers:
#        1: Both `echo` and variable names are case *insensitive* (`echo` = `ECHO` and `$pageTitle` = `$PAGETITLE`)
#        2: Both `echo` and variable names are case *sensitive* (`echo` does not equal `ECHO` and `$pageTitle` does not equal `$PAGETITLE`)
#        3: `echo` is case *insensitive* but variables are case *sensitive* (`echo` = `ECHO` but `$pageTitle` does not equal `$PAGETITLE`)
#        4: `echo` is case *sensitive* but variables are case *insensitive* (`echo` does not equal `ECHO` but `$pageTitle` = `$PAGETITLE`)
#    correct: 3
#    correct_message: |
#        Many things in PHP are case insensitive, like `ECHO` or even `<?PHP`. But variables are different: PHP sees `$pageTitle`
#        and `$PAGETITLE` as completely different. But even when things are case insensitive, you'll see us use lowercase
#        (e.g. `echo`) letters so that our code looks consistent with how most developers write.
#    coding:
#        skeletons: { index.php: CaseSensitivity4/index.php }
#        entry_point: index.php
#        worker: php
#        # this is an ungraded coding box
